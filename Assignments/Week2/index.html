         The front page of incline marketing website is an excellent example of the "rule of thirds" principle in use.

        You can see in my example here that The basic elements are easily cut into thirds on the screen. The 2 logos above and the text on bottom are centered in the middle column. Meanwhile, the "your" carousel and the 2 buttons are centered in the middle row.

            The apache pine website is not a website i reccomend visiting, unless you would like to be assulted with an onslaught of popups, email subscriptions, and nagging self-advertisments. It is not a pleasant experience. It wasnt always like this, but they seem to have taken on a rather aggressive campaign to increase on-site sales. Part of this new design is certainly visual hierarchy. The very first thing that draws the eyes are the "for sale" products at the very top, then to the next largest object, the tagline. After this your eyes will wander around the page for a moment soaking up the logo and other deals the website with throw at you. It is a clever tactic and a well implemented one at that
