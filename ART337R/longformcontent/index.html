                     <h3>What is Sketch Comedy?</h3>
                     <p>
                        Sketch Comedy is a form of comedy that utilizes story
                        telling and visual comedy in contrast to stand-up or
                        improv comedy. It differes from comedic film in that it
                        is normally found in short form (1-10 minutes long).
                     </p>
                     <h3>Can I make Sketch Comedy?</h3>
                     <p>
                        Anybody can write good sketch comedy. Sketch comedy is
                        different than stand-up or improv because it is
                        relatable. Sketch comedy tells stories, and even if the
                        stories are in wild fantastical settings, the actions of
                        the characters mimic reality. Anyone who can relate to
                        the human experience can enjoy and create good sketch
                        comedy.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                        The first thing you need to do is to keep a notebook. Or
                        just take notes on your phone, it doesnt matter. As long
                        as you can have it anywhere you go and can jot down
                        ideas before they escape your brain. I keep a small
                        notebook in my pocket or backpack wherever I go.

                        Not every idea will seem like a winner. It doesn't
                        matter, write it down anyway. Anything that made you
                        think for more than a second. Maybe you trip over the
                        sidewalk, have an awkward conversation, or something
                        just makes you luagh. There are no restrictions at this

                        can have several ideas growing and evolving before

                     <h2>Push it one step to the extreme (what if…)</h2>
                     <p>
                        This is where some brainstorming will come in, take some of your best notes and push them into new territory. Channel your childish humor and ask the classic “what if…” question. Don't be afraid to get wacky, not all ideas will be winners, but it will unlock your creative potential.

                  Now you can see where the story begins to unfold. These “what if” questions begin a story, and your brain fills in the details.

               <h3>Subvert Expectations</h3>
               <p>
                  Most comedy sketches will have some sort of punch line. A punchline is a crucial detail that changes the context of the previous set up. The secret to a good punchline is to subvert expectations of the audience.
               </p>
   
               <p>
                  This does not mean “random = funny”, punchlines need to be relatable/understandable as much as they are unexpected. Some punchlines send the sketch into a whole new level of extreme, while others pull an extreme situation back to reality. Some punchlines are very abrupt and the suddenness alone is funny, others are incredibly subtle and the underlying message or tone is what pulls it through
               </p>
               <h2>Example</h2>
               <p>Your “what if” question could be the punchline, or it could simply be the setup to the punchline</p>

                     Usability testing was our number one source for development

                        We added an icon and some screens for a game idea that
                        could be implemented in the Social section of the app.
                        We think a game would create more personal interactions
                        with living relatives.

                        We added a profile screen that the user could

                        internet… only family members that the parents have
                        allowed to follow the child can view the content.

                        The “About Me” feature are designed to have more

                        It would be really cool to have the “About Me” sections

                     This project has been more than just experimenting with

                     working together as a large group to create a well designed
