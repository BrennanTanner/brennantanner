                     <h3>What is Sketch Comedy?</h3>
                     <p>
                        Sketch Comedy is a form of comedy that utilizes story
                        telling and visual comedy in contrast to stand-up or
                        improv comedy. It differes from comedic film in that it
                        is normally found in short form (1-10 minutes long).
                     </p>
                     <h3>Can I make Sketch Comedy?</h3>
                     <p>
                        Anybody can write good sketch comedy. Sketch comedy is
                        different than stand-up or improv because it is
                        relatable. Sketch comedy tells stories, and even if the
                        stories are in wild fantastical settings, the actions of
                        the characters mimic reality. Anyone who can relate to
                        the human experience can enjoy and create good sketch
                        comedy.

                     <p>
                        The first thing you need to do is to keep a notebook. Or
                        just take notes on your phone, it doesnt matter. As long
                        as you can have it anywhere you go and can jot down
                        ideas before they escape your brain. I keep a small
                        notebook in my pocket or backpack wherever I go.

                        think for more than a second. Maybe you trip over the
                        sidewalk, have an awkward conversation, or something
                        just makes you luagh. There are no restrictions at this

                  Now you can see where the story begins to unfold. These “what
                  if” questions begin a story, and your brain fills in the
                  details.
               </p>
               <h3>Subvert Expectations</h3>
               <p>
                  Most comedy sketches will have some sort of punch line. A
                  punchline is a crucial detail that changes the context of the
                  previous set up. The secret to a good punchline is to subvert
                  expectations of the audience.
               </p>

               <p>
                  This does not mean “random = funny”, punchlines need to be
                  relatable/understandable as much as they are unexpected. Some
                  punchlines send the sketch into a whole new level of extreme,
                  while others pull an extreme situation back to reality. Some
                  punchlines are very abrupt and the suddenness alone is funny,
                  others are incredibly subtle and the underlying message or
                  tone is what pulls it through
               </p>
               <h2>Example</h2>
               <p>
                  Your “what if” question could be the punchline, or it could
                  simply be the setup to the punchline
               </p>

                     <p>
                        Now that you have a premise and a punchline its time to
                        story board. Everybody has a different method, but the
                        concept is the same. Figure out the story beats for your
                        sketch. Figure out the theme, mood, camera angles, even
                        music at this stage. <br />Polish your dialogue. You
                        might write down each line word for word, or you might
                        write down general lines on a note card and take many
                        different takes until you find the line that feels
                        natural.

                        The best part about sketch comedy is that it is
                        incredibly cheap to produce. <br />
                        If you have time and resources, you could certainly go
                        out to a location, film with realistic props and
                        multiple actors. If you can, you certainly should
                        <br />
                        But some of the best sketches are made by one person in
                        their living room, with a green screen, everyday objects
                        filling in for props and edited on their phone. You can
                        use your imagination and the improv could very well
                        improve the sketch.

                        After you make a few sketches, you will begin to figure
                        out what you find funniest. This is your style, do not
                        be afraid to explore your comedy. Find what works what
                        doesn't, play to your strengths.
                        <br />Eventually you will find a personal brand and type
                        of sketch that will bring viewers to your channel.
                        <br />Make what you want not what you feel you have to.
                        Don't ever make something simply for the views if you
                        don't enjoy the content. There is no way faster to burn
                        yourself out. Make what you want and no matter how
                        niche, there are people out there who will enjoy your
                        content, it might just take longer for them to find you.
