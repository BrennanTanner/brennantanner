                Scenario 1: You have found a new recipe on a website and want to save it on your app. You have a screen shot of the recipe saved on your phone.
                <br>
                <br>
                Scenario 2: You have your recipe saved on the Recipe calculator app. Now you need to double your recipe. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Scenario 3: You have found one of your Mee-Ma's famous cookie recipes. But the handwriting is in cursive so the app scanner will not be able to pick out the recipe. You decide to add it by hand.

      This was my first rendition of what I imagined my App to look like. There isn't much here, but I learn invaluable information about what I need to change in future versions.

            This is my first run with Figma. It took a while to learn the functionality of Figma, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. This version of the recipe calulator was simple but I was able to go much more in depth for options for user testing.

            I ended up scrapping this colored version of my app because it did not look good to me. I decided that I had better go back to wireframes and greyscale.

             I am currently testing and changing things in this edition. Hopefully the next one will be a colored version that is a finished product.
